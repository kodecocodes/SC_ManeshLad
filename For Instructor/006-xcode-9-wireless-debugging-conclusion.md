As you can see wireless debugging is really easy and can really benefit your development workflow, even though we didn't go through connecting via IP address for complex networks its fairly easy and well documented by Apple.

For those of you building AR and VR apps, wireless debugging will really help you test your apps in real world situations.

For those building tvOS apps, wireless debugging on a device, connected to a real TV or Home Theater System will help you test your application in real world setups, TV overscan issues with collection views are common in apple TV development.

Thanks for watching.
